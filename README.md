LifeStream - Blood Donation Alert System 🩸 LifeStream is a real-time, web-based blood donation alert system designed to bridge the gap between blood donors and hospitals in emergency situations. It allows potential donors in Pune to register their details and enables authorized hospital staff to send instant SMS alerts to matching donors in a specific area when there's an urgent need for blood.

✨ Key Features 👥 Dual-Mode Interface: Separate, user-friendly tabs for Donor Registration and Hospital Alerts.

🔒 Secure Hospital Access: The emergency alert form is password-protected to prevent misuse and ensure only authorized personnel can send requests.

🎯 Targeted Alerts: Hospitals can filter donors by blood group and specific areas within Pune to notify the most relevant people.

🚀 Instant SMS Notifications: Integrates with the Twilio API to send immediate, life-saving SMS alerts directly to registered donors' phones.

📱 Responsive Design: A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🌐 Interactive UI: Features an engaging animated background using particles.js for a dynamic user experience.

📞 Smart Phone Field: The donor registration form automatically formats Indian phone numbers and ensures a valid +91 prefix.
