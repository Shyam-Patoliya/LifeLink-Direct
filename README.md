LifeStream - Blood Donation Alert System ü©∏ LifeStream is a real-time, web-based blood donation alert system designed to bridge the gap between blood donors and hospitals in emergency situations.

‚ú® Key Features üë• Dual-Mode Interface: Separate, user-friendly tabs for Donor Registration and Hospital Alerts.

üîí Secure Hospital Access: The emergency alert form is password-protected to prevent misuse and ensure only authorized personnel can send requests.

üéØ Targeted Alerts: Hospitals can filter donors by blood group and specific areas within Pune to notify the most relevant people.

üöÄ Instant SMS Notifications: Integrates with the Twilio API to send immediate, life-saving SMS alerts directly to registered donors' phones.

üì± Responsive Design: A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

üåê Interactive UI: Features an engaging animated background using particles.js for a dynamic user experience.

üìû Smart Phone Field: The donor registration form automatically formats Indian phone numbers and ensures a valid +91 prefix.
